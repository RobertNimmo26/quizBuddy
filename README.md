## Google Calendar API
We have used the Google Calendar API in our web app which requires you to get a api key and update the client id in the javascript script

#### Instructions to set up:
* To generate an api key follow this link: [https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)
* In the quizBuddy folder (where the settings.py file is) create a new file called ".env"
* In the ".env" file add 
APIKEY = < Your generated API key >
* In the addEvent.js file (which is in the static/javascript directory) change the clientId to your generated clientId 

#### Extra Information:
Due to Google API restrictions to run the Django webapp on your local device you will have to use the url [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
